Manatki (rus мана́тки - belongings,
    goods and chattels ) - a collection of small recipes
Most of these somehow relates to [typelevel cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) or [akka](https://typelevel.org/cats/) or idk

Most of things was mentioned in russian scala group (https://t.me/scala_ru) but this is not a strict rule.
