## Manatki

Manatki (rus мана́тки - belongings,
    goods and chattels ) - a collection of small recipes
Some of these somehow relate to [typelevel cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/)
or [akka](https://typelevel.org/cats/) or idk. Some of them are just invention playground and absolutely can't be used by a sane coder anywhere.

Most of the things were mentioned in the Russian scala group (https://t.me/scala_ru) but this is not a strict rule.
In the case code comments must include date and time of discussion for ease of search and reference.
